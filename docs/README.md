## About DAO

> The DAO is an exciting concept whose core is the desire for equal authority, multi-party decision-making, and the elimination of uncontrollable risks arising from authoritarian governance as much as possible. DAO is a new type of management that was born for governance.
>
>  As the most in line with the spirit of blockchain governance, DAO must have its place in the blockchain ecological map, and is an indispensable and important piece of the puzzle.

## Our Vision

##### Voluntary commitment

Since the name of DAO is "Autonomous Decentralization", there is no specific authority. In the "company", the "CEO" makes decisions and gives instructions to the "employees". In "DAO", there is no "CEO" in the first place. Of course, there is no concept of "employee" either. In DAOs, the pyramid structure is basically negated. The premise of working at DAO is that "everyone actively demonstrates his/her special abilities and contributes to the project". You are always a "proposer" and a "contributor", and the DAO needs your advice and contributions. It can be said that in order to work in DAO, your project and your interests need to have a high degree of fit. Your contribution is maximized when "what you can/want to do" and "what the DAO should do" overlap. If you work for a DAO, no one will give you directions. If you can contribute a lot, you will be recognized as a "core contributor" and will be rewarded and honored.

#####  Regardless of age, gender or nationality, pay for performance and participate anonymously 

In the past, when working at a company, it was necessary to verify the identity of a person, but at DAOs, this common sense is outdated. When you work for the DAO, you are not required to provide more personal information than is necessary. Because DAOs are anonymous, they are also paid per contribution. Regardless of your age, gender or nationality, what matters is your contribution to the DAO. Prehistoric worker spirits, such as "work earlier than others, show loyalty" and "be loyal to your boss" are completely a thing of the past. Welcome to a flat, pay-for-performance society.

##### Rewards are tokens

Last but not least, the price of the contribution is the "project issued token". If you work for a company, we will "receive fiat currency by bank transfer". "Receive tokens in a cryptocurrency wallet" is common sense when working at DAOs. Accepting fiat currency as a reward can be considered a special case. Tokens earned as rewards can be sold on the spot or held and managed as-is. If you think your project will grow, you may not sell it but buy more. These tokens are usually so-called "governance (voting) tokens". The more you contribute, the more governance tokens you earn. You can reflect your intentions and interests in important decisions on your project. Using rewards as tokens to create some kind of gameplay is also an innovation of DAO.
